# **Little Sister Pokemon Task**
## **About:**
#### As my little sister began her playthrough of Pokemon Sword, Fairy type pokemon grew to be her favorite type, but she had a couple of encounters which ended in defeat. She believed that it was due to her Pokemon's lack of offensive power, and as such proposed to me 2 questions which I expanded upon in order to get a better sense of the scope of her inquiry.
* How do the stats of fairy types compare to other types accross all games?
* What is the best offensive option for a fairy type pokemon in pokemon sword?
#### To fulfill the requirements of the project, I gathered a comprehensive dataset of Pokemon in order to extract insight on the offensive power of Fairy type Pokemon. This notebook serves as a means to learn the use of API's and webscraping basics, as well as excersising my python and pandas analysis skills.
## **Skills/Technologies Showcased:**
